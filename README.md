# 9_sensor_lfr_code
 code for 9 sensor lfr to be run on white strips on black board in this the sensors are alligned as extreme left to center (A0-A3) exact center at digital 2 and then right center to extreme right (A4-A7)
 code is made for Arduino nano board.
 the algorithm used is self designed and do not resemble any type of algorithm structure known.
 here you will be adding all left sensor multiplying them based on there position and at last comparing them with same pattern for right and then passing the output to motors and mapping at last to (0-255) for output.
 this program was a solo project built by Harsh Nandwana, Student of Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Swami Keshvanand Institute of Technology, Jaipur,
